# Spire
Spire is a shading language and compiler framework that facilitates modular shader authoring and rapid exploration of shader optimization choices (such as frequency reduction and algorithmic approximation) afforded by modern real-time graphics engines. The current implementation of the Spire compiler can generate either GLSL or SPIR-V output for use with OpenGL and Vulkan based engines.

For an example of intergrating Spire into a game engine, head to this repository:

Note: This repository is no longer being updated. Code here is used to produce the work of our SIGGRAPH 2017 publication. Please check out our latest development of the Spire shading language at https://github.com/shader-slang/slang.
